            <p id= "para1" >The ingredients make a big part of the flavor of the dessert we're making. In the first recipes of the United States most of the people wondered how many ingredients were necessary in their preparation but, our pastry chefs with 30 years of experience give us a list of how to replace the 3 most essential ingredients in pastry, either by the lack of them, by allergies or by different types of diets that you can do, this is what our site offers, making it easier for you. </p>

            <p id= "para2">Sometimes when we know we don't have certain ingredients it makes us stop baking our desserts. The reality is that there are several ingredients that can be replaced and give us the same result or sometimes better, but this time we will only concentrate on 3: flour, eggs, and butter. Flour is a very important ingredient since it gives it the structure, flavor, well almost everything, you could say almost impossible to replace but we have tips and options for you. Eggs and butter are a little easier to replace, they can be with fruits or oils of different types, the secret is to know the necessary portions and some flavorings to make our dessert something special to share with our loved ones. </p>
