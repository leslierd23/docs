        The ingredients make a big part of the flavor of the dessert we're making. In the first recipes of the United States most of the people wondered how many ingredients were necessary in their preparation but, our pastry chefs with 30 years of experience give us a list of how to replace the 3 most essential ingredients in pastry.

        Not only the preparation of the cake is important, but what makes a very professional dessert look is its decoration at all. We have floral decorations that fit all kinds of special occasions, from small flowers to flowers of larger sizes even in jellies. These decorations are very simple since they only need our special touch.
